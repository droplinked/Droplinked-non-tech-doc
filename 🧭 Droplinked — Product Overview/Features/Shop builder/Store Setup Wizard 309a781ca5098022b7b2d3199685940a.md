## PART 1: HUMAN-CENTRIC LAYER

---

### 1) **Summary**

**Problem/Value:**
New merchants need a guided setup wizard to complete essential store configuration tasks. The wizard should be prominently displayed on the dashboard and remain visible until all steps are completed. Unlike the registration process, this wizard focuses on store setup tasks that prepare the merchant for selling.

**Desired Outcome:**

- Setup wizard widget displays on dashboard on every login until 100% complete
- Checklist contains 5-7 essential setup steps
- Each step links directly to the relevant dashboard section
- Progress bar shows completion percentage
- Completed steps are visually marked
- Wizard can be collapsed but remains accessible
- Once 100% complete, wizard minimizes to compact "Setup Complete" badge
- Wizard state persists across sessions

---

### 2) **Scope – In / Out**

**In Scope:**

- **Dashboard Widget**
    - Persistent widget showing setup progress

### **FL-1: Setup Steps Definition**

```
SETUP_STEPS = [
    {
        id: 'complete_profile',
        title: 'Complete Your Profile',
        description: 'Add your business information and logo',
        link: '/settings/profile',
        completion_check: 'merchant.profile_complete == true'
    },
    {
        id: 'add_first_product',
        title: 'Add Your First Product',
        description: 'Create your first product listing',
        link: '/products/create',
        completion_check: 'merchant.product_count > 0'
    },
    {
        id: 'connect_payment',
        title: 'Connect Payment Method',
        description: 'Set up how you want to get paid',
        link: '/settings/payments',
        completion_check: 'merchant.payment_connected == true'
    },

        title: 'Customize Your Storefront',
        description: 'Design your shop appearance',
        link: '/designer',
        completion_check: 'merchant.storefront_customized == true'
    },
    {
        id: 'set_shipping',
        title: 'Set Up Shipping',
        description: 'Configure your shipping rates and zones',
        link: '/settings/shipping',
        completion_check: 'merchant.shipping_configured == true'
    },
    {
        id: 'add_domain',
        title: 'Connect Custom Domain',
        description: 'Use your own domain name',
        link: '/settings/domain',

        description: 'Review your store and go live',
        link: '/preview',
        completion_check: 'merchant.store_published == true'
    }
]
```

### **FL-2: Wizard Display Logic**

```
ON DashboardLoad:
    merchant = getCurrentMerchant()
    wizard_state = getWizardState(merchant.id)

    // Calculate completion
    completed_steps = 0
    FOR each step IN SETUP_STEPS:
        IF evaluate(step.completion_check) == true:
            completed_steps += 1

    completion_percentage = (completed_steps / SETUP_STEPS.length) * 100

    // Determine widget state
    IF completion_percentage == 100:
        IF wizard_state.dismissed:
            SHOW compact_badge_only
        ELSE:
            SHOW completion_celebration
            SET wizard_state.dismissed = true
    ELSE:
        IF wizard_state.collapsed:
            SHOW collapsed_widget(completion_percentage)
        ELSE:
            SHOW full_wizard(completed_steps, SETUP_STEPS)
```

---

### **FL-3: Step Completion Detection**

```
ON MerchantAction(action_type):
    // Triggered when merchant completes relevant actions

    SWITCH action_type:
        CASE 'profile_updated':
            CHECK completion for 'complete_profile'

        CASE 'product_created':
            CHECK completion for 'add_first_product'

        CASE 'payment_method_added':
            CHECK completion for 'connect_payment'

        CASE 'theme_customized':
            CHECK completion for 'customize_storefront'

        CASE 'shipping_configured':
            CHECK completion for 'set_shipping'

        CASE 'domain_connected':
            CHECK completion for 'add_domain'

        CASE 'store_published':
            CHECK completion for 'preview_launch'

    // Recalculate and update wizard
    UPDATE wizard display

    IF all_steps_complete AND NOT celebration_shown:
        TRIGGER celebration_animation
```

---

### **FL-4: Widget Interaction Logic**

```
ON ClickStep(step_id):
    step = FIND step IN SETUP_STEPS WHERE step.id == step_id
    NAVIGATE to step.link

ON ClickCollapse:
    SET wizard_state.collapsed = true
    UPDATE UI to show collapsed widget

ON ClickExpand:
    SET wizard_state.collapsed = false
    UPDATE UI to show full wizard

ON ClickDismissCompletion:
    SET wizard_state.dismissed = true
    HIDE celebration, SHOW compact badge

ON ClickResetWizard:
    // Available in Settings → Store Setup
    RESET wizard_state
    RECALCULATE all completions
```

| **EC-4:** All steps complete but widget still shows | Force refresh on next dashboard load |
