### 1) **Summary**

**Problem/Value:**

Merchants want the ability to display and sell products using cryptocurrency tokens instead of only USD. The **Token Pricing** feature allows merchants to set product prices in a chosen token (e.g., USDC), while showing the equivalent USD amount for clarity. This ensures transparency for customers and enables seamless crypto payments.

**Desired Outcome:**

- Merchants can select a token to display product pricing.
- Product prices and cart totals update in real-time to reflect the chosen token.
- USD equivalents are shown alongside the token price for customer clarity.
- Supports Web3 payments for token-based purchases.

### 2) **Scope – In / Out**

**In:**

- Set product prices in one selected token (e.g., USDC).
- Display equivalent USD price for each product in the storefront and cart.
- Apply token pricing to all products in the merchant’s shop.
- Integrate with Web3 wallet and payment options to accept token payments.

**Out:**

- Multiple tokens per product (only one token per product at a time).
- Advanced crypto conversions beyond USD equivalents.
- Dynamic real-time token price fluctuations (static conversion at time of display).

### **Journey 3: Customer Checkout**

- I add products to the cart.
- Cart totals show prices in the selected token and USD equivalent.
