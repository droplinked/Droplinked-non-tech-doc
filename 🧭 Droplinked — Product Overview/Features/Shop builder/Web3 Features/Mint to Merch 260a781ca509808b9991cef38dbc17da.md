### 1) **Summary**

**Problem/Value:**

Merchants may want the ability to create **exclusive NFTs** directly tied to their products, providing unique digital assets for customers and collectors. This feature, when implemented, will allow merchants to mint these NFTs and integrate them with their Droplinked storefront.

**Desired Outcome:**

- Merchants can mint exclusive NFTs for products directly from their dashboard.
- NFTs are associated with individual products for ownership, traceability, and potential resale.
- Provides a new channel for product monetization and collector engagement in Web3.

- Display of minted NFT in the dashboard and optionally on the product page.

**Out (Not included in initial version):**

- Automatic NFT minting for all products.
- Marketplace integration for NFT resale.
- Complex metadata or customizable NFT attributes beyond basic product info.
