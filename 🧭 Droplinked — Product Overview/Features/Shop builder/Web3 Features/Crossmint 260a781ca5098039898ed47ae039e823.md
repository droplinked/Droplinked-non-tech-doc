**Desired Outcome:**

- Merchants can record products to Crossmint manually from the product page.
- Products are minted as NFTs with traceable ownership on the blockchain.
- The feature ensures transparency and accountability for digital or tokenized products.
- Merchants can bridge their physical or digital products seamlessly to a blockchain ecosystem.
