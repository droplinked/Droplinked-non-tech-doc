Enabled merchants to offer **PayPal** as a fiat payment provider alongside Stripe. Customers can now complete purchases using PayPal at checkout.

**2. Record NFTs on XION**

Merchants can now **record their products as NFTs** on the **XION blockchain** and accept payments using XION tokens. Full support added for Layer 1 integration via CosmWasm smart contracts (Rust-based).

**3. CredibleX Partnership Integration**

Added a dedicated **CredibleX** page in the merchant dashboard sidebar. The integration embeds the CredibleX Web SDK directly, allowing merchants to complete verification forms without leaving Droplinked.
