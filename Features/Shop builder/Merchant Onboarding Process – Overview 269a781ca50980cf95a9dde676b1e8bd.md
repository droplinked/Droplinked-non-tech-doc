### 1) **Summary**

The onboarding process guides newly registered merchants through the initial shop setup on Droplinked. Its goal is to ensure merchants configure critical shop details, optionally use AI tools for accelerated setup, select a default currency, understand plan options, and become familiar with Droplinked resources. The process is designed to make the merchant’s first experience smooth, structured, and actionable.

### 2) **Process Overview**

The onboarding process includes several steps:

1. **Existing Website Selection** – Merchants indicate whether they have a pre-existing website (Yes/No).
2. **Shop Details & AI Setup** – Merchants enter mandatory shop information (URL, Name), optional details (logo, hero section, description), and can optionally use AI to generate shop metadata and design. The system validates shop URL uniqueness and offers a toggle to create 3 default products for inspiration.
3. **Default Currency Selection** – Merchants can set the shop’s default currency or skip this step, with the ability to change later.
4. **Plan Upgrade for AI Features** – If the merchant opts for AI-assisted setup, a modal prompts them to upgrade their plan to access AI features. Merchants who skip the upgrade cannot use AI features.
5. **Droplinked Resources & YouTube** – Merchants are shown Droplinked social media channels and instructional videos for additional guidance and platform familiarity.

### 3) **Outcome**

- Has optional AI-assisted metadata and design for shop branding (if plan allows).
- Has default currency set or skipped.
- Understands plan options and AI feature eligibility.
- Is familiar with Droplinked resources and instructional videos.
