### 1) **Summary**

**Problem/Value:**

Merchants need a seamless way to connect their blockchain wallets to the Droplinked platform. Wallet connectivity allows merchants to authenticate, track, and manage blockchain transactions for their products. Connecting wallets also enables features like NFT minting, Web3 payments, and ruleset validation for product collections.

**Desired Outcome:**

- Merchants can select from a list of supported networks and connect their wallet via browser extensions (e.g., MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet).
- Wallet addresses are saved per network and displayed in the dashboard.
- Once connected, merchants can use the wallet for NFT management, token pricing, and Web3 payments.
- The connection provides secure, account-level authentication without requiring additional credentials.

### 2) **Scope – In / Out**

**In:**

- Display a **Connect Wallet modal** with supported blockchain networks.
- Merchants can select one or multiple networks to connect.
- Connect wallet using browser wallet extensions (e.g., MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet).
- Save wallet address for each network in the merchant’s shop profile.
- Display connected wallet address in the dashboard instead of the connect button.
- Allow merchants to disconnect or switch wallets per network.
- Integrate wallet connection with NFT minting, token pricing, and ruleset features.

**Out:**

- Advanced multi-signature wallet support.
