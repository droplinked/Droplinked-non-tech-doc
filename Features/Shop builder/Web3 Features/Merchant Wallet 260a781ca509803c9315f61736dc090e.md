# Merchant Wallet

# **Feature ID:** IAA-WLT-110

# **Category:** Payments & Web3 | **Actors:** Merchant

# **Status:** Released

# **Owner:** Behdad

# **1) Summary**

### **Problem / Value**

Merchants need a secure, simple way to participate in Web3 features such as NFT minting, token pricing, and Web3-based rulesets. Many merchants are not crypto-native, so they should not be required to manually create or manage blockchain wallets.

The **Circle Wallets** service ([https://www.circle.com/wallets](https://www.circle.com/wallets)) provides secure custodial wallet infrastructure enabling merchants to use Web3 features without dealing with private keys.

Previously, wallets were created automatically during sign-up. Updated requirements specify that wallets must be **manually created by the merchant** from the settings page.

### **Desired Outcome**

- Merchant can manually create their Circle Wallet from **Settings → Payments & Wallets**.
- After creation, the wallet address is displayed to the merchant.
- Wallet integrates automatically with all Web3 features in Droplinked.
- Private key management remains fully secure and hidden from merchants.

# **2) Scope – In / Out**

### **In Scope**

- Adding a **Merchant Wallet** section in
    
    **Settings → Payments & Wallets**.
    
- Displaying a **“Create Merchant Wallet”** button if no wallet exists.
- Creating a unique Circle Wallet for the merchant upon button click.
- Showing:
    - Wallet Address
    - Wallet Balance (USDC or supported assets)
- Wallet becomes the default wallet for:
    - NFT Minting
    - Token Pricing
    - Rulesets
    - Web3 Payment Receiving
- All backend private key handling (Circle custodial).

### **Out of Scope**

- Auto-creation of wallets on registration (removed).
- Manual private key access or download.
- Multi-wallet support (only 1 wallet per merchant).
- Sending assets on-chain (handled by separate features).
- Cross-chain wallet selection.
