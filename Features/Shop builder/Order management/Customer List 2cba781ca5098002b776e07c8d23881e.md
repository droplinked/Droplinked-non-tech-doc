# **1) Summary**

### **Problem / Value**

Merchants need visibility into who their buyers are to understand their audience, track loyalty, and analyze revenue sources. Currently, customer data might be scattered across individual order details.
This feature provides a centralized **Customers** page that lists all unique users who have made a successful purchase from the shop. It offers a quick overview of spending habits and geographical distribution.

### **Desired Outcome**

- A dedicated "Customers" page in the Merchant Dashboard.
- Display a list of unique customers based on **successful orders**.
- Show an **Empty State** for new shops with no sales.
- Display key metrics per customer: Name, Email, Total Orders, Total Spent (USD), Last Order Date, and Location.
- **Conditional Logic:** "Name" and "Location" (Country/State) are populated based on shipping data from physical product orders.

# **2) Scope – In / Out**

### **In Scope**

- **Definition of Customer:** A unique email address that has completed at least one order with "Paid/Success" status.
- **Empty State:** Visual placeholder encouraging the merchant to make their first sale.
- **Data Table Columns:**
    - **Name:** (Visible only if the customer provided shipping info for a Physical Product).
    - **Email:** (Always visible).
    - **Total Orders:** Count of successful orders.
    - **Total Spent:** Sum of the value of all successful orders (in USD).
    - **Last Order:** Date of the most recent successful purchase.
    - **Country & State:** (Visible only if the customer provided shipping info for a Physical Product).
- **Pagination:** Handling lists for shops with many customers.

### **Out of Scope**

- Customer Detail View (Drill-down profile page) – *Future Release*.
- Exporting customer list (CSV/Excel).
- CRM actions (Emailing customers directly from this list).
- Manually adding/editing customers.

# **4) Business Acceptance Criteria (BAC)**

**BAC 1:** A "Customer" is defined as a user who has completed at least one **successful** transaction. Users with only "Failed" or "Abandoned" carts must not appear.
**BAC 2:** The Customers page must display an **Empty State** if the list count is 0.
**BAC 3:** **Data Columns:** The table must include Name, Email, Total Orders, Total Spent ($), Last Order Date, and Location (Country/State).
**BAC 4:** **Physical vs. Digital Logic:**
- **Name, Country, and State** fields must be populated from the Shipping Address.
- If a customer has **only** purchased Digital products (no Shipping Address provided), these fields should remain empty or display a placeholder (e.g., "-").
**BAC 5:** **Total Spent Calculation:** Must be the sum of the `Final Price` of all successful orders associated with that customer's email for this specific shop.
**BAC 6:** **Uniqueness:** The list must be unique by Email address (no duplicate rows for the same customer).
