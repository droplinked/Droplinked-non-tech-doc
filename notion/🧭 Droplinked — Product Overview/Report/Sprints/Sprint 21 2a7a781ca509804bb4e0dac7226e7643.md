# Sprint 21

🏁 **Next Sprint – Planning Summary**

**Date Range: November 11, 2025**  → November 24, 2025 

**Prepared by:** Behdad

**Sprint Goal:** Launch universal checkout, professional affiliate system, agentic commerce, and enhanced merchant tools while stabilizing admin and payment infrastructure.

---

✅ **Planned Features / Outcomes**

**1. Universal Single-Page Checkout**

Build a **unified checkout interface** at `checkout.droplinked.io/cart/:cartId` where buyers can complete purchases (address, shipping, payment) in a single reusable component.

This standardizes the checkout experience across all entry points (embedded product tiles, affiliate stores, and Droplinked shops) to improve UX consistency, speed, and conversion rates.

**2. Professional Affiliate Panel (MVP)**

Develop an **affiliate-based distributed selling system**:

- Merchants (Owners) can enable affiliate capability at the shop or product level.
- Affiliators can import products to their storefronts.
- Orders, commissions, and dashboards are handled automatically.
- Phase 1 addresses money splitting, refunds, chargebacks, and reconciliation.

**3. Agentic Commerce (Phase 1)**

Enable merchants to **interact with AI agents** to perform certain actions within Droplinked, laying the foundation for intelligent commerce automation.

**4. Embeddable Product Tile Component**

Provide merchants with a **lightweight, embeddable product component** that:

- Shows key product details with a functional Buy button.
- Renders consistently across websites.
- Supports simple styling and checkout redirection.
    
    This empowers merchants to expand product reach outside of Droplinked-hosted shops.
    

**5. Admin Backend Rebuild & Reactivation**

Restore the **Admin backend domain** managing merchant shops, which became non-functional after previous refactors.

Focus: backend logic and API compatibility to support the existing admin frontend with no visual or functional UI changes.

**6. XION Token Payment Integration**

Enable merchants to **accept XION token payments natively**:

- Activate XION as a shop payment method.
- Customers can pay with XION tokens at checkout.
- All payments linked to blockchain transactions, with full edge-case handling.

**7. Test Coverage & QA Validation**

Improve **frontend and backend test coverage** for critical user and merchant flows:

- User registration & login
- Product management (Create, Edit, Delete, Publish)
- Shop payment settings
- Cart & checkout process
- Onboarding flow
    
    Goal: prevent regressions and ensure functional reliability.
    

**8. Advanced Storefront Designer**

Enable merchants to **design and customize their entire storefront** with a flexible drag-and-drop builder (like Elementor or Shopify Theme Editor) while preserving essential system components (e.g., add-to-cart, SKU selector).

**9. Shareable Product Link**

Allow merchants to **generate a shareable link for any product**, enabling customers to view and purchase the product directly via that link. This expands product accessibility beyond embedded tiles or shops.
