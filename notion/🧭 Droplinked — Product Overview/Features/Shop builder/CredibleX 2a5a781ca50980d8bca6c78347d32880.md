### 1) **Summary**

**Problem/Value:**

Merchants need a seamless way to complete CredibleX partnership forms without leaving the Droplinked platform. Currently, external navigation interrupts workflow and reduces adoption of financing partnerships. Integrating CredibleX directly into the dashboard improves merchant experience and increases conversion rates for partnership enrollment.

**Desired Outcome:**

- A new “Financing” menu item in the merchant sidebar links to the CredibleX form.
- Merchants can complete and submit the form directly within Droplinked dashboard.
- Form submission feedback (success or error) is displayed immediately.
- Integration uses CredibleX Web SDK for secure and consistent data handling.

---

### 2) **Scope – In / Out**

**In:**

- Add “Financing” menu item to merchant dashboard sidebar.
- Load CredibleX Web SDK form within Droplinked dashboard page.
- Handle form submission via SDK and provide merchant with real-time success/error feedback.
- Ensure page is responsive and fully functional within Droplinked UI.

**Out:**

- Custom backend handling of CredibleX form submission.
- Editing or storing submitted data outside CredibleX SDK.
- Support for mobile dashboard apps (desktop dashboard only).
- Additional form fields or customization beyond CredibleX SDK.
