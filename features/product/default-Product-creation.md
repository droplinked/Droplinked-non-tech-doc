 
# Feature Name: Default Product Creation on Shop Design

**Version number:** 2.0.0  
**Date created/updated:** 2025/06/08

## üîç Description
This feature enables merchants to automatically generate a default set of products when they upload a logo during the shop creation process. By activating the "Create Inspirational Inventory" toggle after uploading the logo, the merchant will have three pre-defined products added to their store within a few minutes. These products feature the uploaded logo and are ready for customization and sale. This feature helps streamline the shop setup process for new merchants.

## üë§ User Stories
- As a **merchant**, I want to **automatically create default products** when I upload my logo and enable the "Create Inspirational Inventory" toggle, so that **I can quickly populate my store with sample products.**
- As a **merchant**, I want to **be able to edit or delete the default products** after they are added, so that **I can customize my store's offerings as needed.**

## üß† Business Logic

### Step 1: **Uploading the Logo**
- **Logic**: The merchant uploads their logo during the shop creation process.
- **Rules**: The logo must be uploaded in a valid format before proceeding.
- **Validation**: The logo must be uploaded before the merchant can activate the "Create Inspirational Inventory" toggle.
- **Outcome**: The logo is successfully uploaded, and the merchant can move forward to enable the toggle.

### Step 2: **Activating the "Create Inspirational Inventory" Toggle**
- **Logic**: After uploading the logo, the merchant activates the "Create Inspirational Inventory" toggle. By doing this, they enable the automatic generation of default products for their store.
- **Rules**: The toggle is off by default and must be manually activated by the merchant. 
- **Validation**: The toggle cannot be activated unless a logo has been uploaded.
- **Outcome**: The toggle is activated, and the process to generate products begins.

### Step 3: **Generation of Default Products**
- **Logic**: Once the toggle is enabled, within approximately 5 minutes, the system automatically creates three default products in the store:
  - One hoodie
  - One men's t-shirt
  - One women's top
  These products will feature the uploaded logo as part of their design.
- **Rules**: 
  - The products are predefined (hoodie, t-shirt, and top) and feature the uploaded logo.
  - This process typically takes around 5 minutes but may vary slightly in time.
- **Validation**: The system ensures that the three products are created in the merchant's store and that the logo is correctly applied.
- **Outcome**: Three default products are successfully added to the store.

### Step 4: **Editing or Deleting the Default Products**
- **Logic**: After the products have been added to the store, the merchant can edit or delete them as desired.
- **Rules**: Merchants can edit the products' details, such as name, description, price, or images, or they can delete them entirely.
- **Validation**: No specific validation is required at this stage. The merchant has full control over the products.
- **Outcome**: The merchant successfully customizes or deletes the default products from their store.
