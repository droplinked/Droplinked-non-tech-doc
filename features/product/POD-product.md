# Feature Name: Print-on-Demand (POD) Product Management

**Version number:** 1.0.0  
**Date created/updated:** 2025/05/27


## 1. Overview:

The Print On Demand (POD) Product feature allows merchants on the Droplinked platform to create customized products through an integrated third-party design tool (Printful Design Maker). Merchants select a blank product catalog item, design their product via the external design tool, and the system generates multiple SKUs (variants) based on the designs. Unlike other product types, POD products rely on Printful to create variants and assign external IDs, while merchants set prices for each SKU. POD products do not require merchants to specify shipping types or packaging sizes. This feature streamlines the creation of personalized, print-on-demand products, leveraging third-party design and production capabilities while ensuring pricing controls on merchant side.

## 2. User Story:

- **As a** merchant,  
- **I want to** create Print On Demand products by selecting blank catalog items and designing them through an integrated tool,  
- **So that I can** offer custom-designed products without managing variants or shipping logistics directly.

## 4. Inputs:

- **User Inputs**:  
  - Title (optional): Default title is set, can be edited by merchant.  
  - Description (optional): Default description is set, can be edited by merchant.  
  - Blank Catalog Product: Selected from a list of base products provided by Printful.

  - SKU Prices: Merchant must input prices for each generated SKU, which must exceed Printful’s production cost for that SKU.

---

## 5. Logic and Process:

1. **Catalog Selection**:  
   Merchant selects a blank product from the Printful catalog via a pop-up interface.

2. **Design Creation**:  
   Printful Design Maker opens in a pop-up where the merchant creates the custom design.

3. **SKU Generation**:  
   After submitting the design, Printful generates multiple SKUs based on product variations and design options, providing external IDs and production costs.

4. **Price Assignment**:  
   Merchant sets the price for each SKU, which must be greater than the production cost indicated for that SKU.

5. **Product Metadata**:  
   Default title and description are pre-filled; merchants can modify them or accept the defaults.

6. **Saving Product**:  
   Once prices are assigned and optional edits made, the product is saved and added to the merchant’s catalog.

---

## 6. Outputs:

- **SKU List**:  
  The product displays multiple SKUs generated by Printful, each with assigned price and external ID.

- **Database Update**:  
  The product with all SKUs and associated pricing is saved in the database and visible in the product list and storefront.

- **UI Notification**:  
  Merchants receive toast notifications confirming successful creation or update.

---

## 7. Error Handling and Troubleshooting:

- **Error 1**: Merchant fails to select a blank catalog product.  
  - **Solution**: Display an error prompting selection before proceeding.

- **Error 2**: Merchant attempts to set SKU prices lower than production costs.  
  - **Solution**: Prevent saving and notify merchant to set valid prices.

- **Error 3**: Failure to load or submit design in Printful Design Maker.  
  - **Solution**: Show retry option and log the error for investigation.

- **Error 4**: Failure to save POD product due to server or database issues.  
  - **Solution**: Notify merchant and allow retry; log errors.

---

## 8. Testing and Validation:

- **Test Case 1**: Select a blank catalog product, design it via Printful Design Maker, assign valid SKU prices, and save product successfully.  
- **Test Case 2**: Attempt to save product with missing blank catalog selection and verify error message appears.  
- **Test Case 3**: Attempt to set SKU prices below production costs and verify validation error prevents saving.  
- **Test Case 4**: Simulate failure in Design Maker loading and verify retry mechanism.  
- **Test Case 5**: Verify product and SKUs appear correctly in merchant’s product list and storefront after saving.

## 9. Change Log:

- **[Date]**: Initial release of Print On Demand (POD) Product feature integrating with Printful Design Maker, supporting SKU generation, pricing, and product creation workflows.

---

## 10. Limitations and Notes:

- **Limitations**:  
  - Design Maker is a third-party tool with no direct modification by Droplinked.  
  - SKU generation and external IDs are controlled by Printful.  
  - Shipping types and packaging sizes are not managed by merchants for POD products.  
  - SKU prices must always exceed production costs.

- **Notes**:  
  - Merchants should ensure price settings are carefully managed to maintain profitability.  
  - Documentation for Print On Demand products is maintained separately due to unique integration requirements.
