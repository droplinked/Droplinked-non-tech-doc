# Feature Name: Multi-Language Support for Shop Builder

**Version number:** 2.0.0  
**Date created/updated:** 2025/06/08

## üîç Description
This feature allows merchants to select between Arabic and English for the language of their Shop Builder site. A dropdown in the footer of the Shop Builder enables users to easily switch between the two languages. When a language is selected, the entire site language is updated accordingly. If the Arabic language is selected, the site will also switch to a Right-to-Left (RTL) layout to accommodate Arabic text direction.
