# Feature Name: Crossmint Product Recording

**Version number:** 2.0.0  
**Date created/updated:** 2025/06/08


## üîç Description
This feature allows merchants to record their imported products as NFTs using the Crossmint wallet. After importing products using the product input feature, merchants can activate a toggle to record their imported products into the Crossmint wallet. This feature is currently in beta, allowing a maximum of 50 products to be recorded in one batch. Once the request is made, the recording process takes some time (approximately 20 minutes). After the process completes, merchants can export the NFTs to their MetaMask wallet.
