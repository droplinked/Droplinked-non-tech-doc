# Feature Name: Reset Password

**Version number:** 2.0.0  
**Date created/updated:** 2025/05/27

## üîç Description
The **Reset Password** feature allows users to reset their password through a simple process initiated from the login page. When a user forgets their password, they can request a reset by entering their email address. A 6-digit code is sent to their email, which the user then enters to verify their identity. After successfully entering the code, the user can set a new password, which will be validated based on certain conditions. Once the password is updated, the user is notified of the success and can proceed to log in with their new password.

## üë§ User Stories
- As a **user**, I want to **reset my password** if I forget it, so that **I can regain access to my account**.

- **Rules**: 
  - The code is unique to the user‚Äôs email and can be used only once.

### Step 5: **Setting the New Password**
- **Logic**: After the code is successfully verified, the user is prompted to set a new password and confirm it by entering it again.
- **Rules**: 
  - The new password must meet the system‚Äôs security criteria (e.g., minimum length, contains a special character, etc.).
  - The password confirmation field must match the new password field.
- **Validation**: 
  - The password must meet all security criteria.
